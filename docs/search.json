    "text": "Introduction\nI’m Paul Probst, a data science student at Brigham Young University (BYU) with a minor in Business, graduating in April 2027. I’m interested in applying machine learning and data engineering to real-world problems—from property risk and supply chain optimization to research in oncology and survey analysis. I aim to be both rigorous and collaborative in how I work with data and teams."

    "text": "Experience\n\nData Analyst, BYU Research & Reporting, Provo, UT (August 2023 – Present)\nDesigned custom R analyses for university data to identify patterns in enrollment across 35,000+ students. Built reusable SQL data marts adopted by 500+ users. Developed Tableau dashboards and tabular reports with row-level security for executives, public media, and accreditation. Supported team ML projects with data engineering, schema documentation, and visualization.\nData Science Intern, FM Global Research & Development, Providence, RI (April 2024 – November 2024)\nTrained and validated supervised ML models to quantify natural disaster property risk and estimate replacement cost, improving predictive accuracy by over 60%. Integrated software providers and data vendors into a cohesive data science workflow. Built end-to-end Python data engineering pipelines for multi-source tabular and imagery metadata. Productionized features at scale for 3k+ properties/day and led model QA: challenger–champion comparisons, cross-validation, and error analysis.\nOperations Data Analyst, Modern Energy, Worcester, MA (April 2024 – August 2024)\nImplemented and maintained inventory management software, optimizing database performance by 40%. Conducted supply chain optimization and demand forecasting to reduce costs. Used data to identify trends and inefficiencies in order fulfillment. Maintained real-time supply chain data and predictive analytics, improving turnaround times by 3 weeks.\nResearch Assistant, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT (August 2024 – Present)\nAnalyzed experimental oncology datasets using Bayesian modeling and regression in Python to estimate treatment–response curves and identify optimal dosage levels. Structured raw lab data from dose-escalation experiments for reproducibility. Developed visualizations and summary reports to translate statistical findings into actionable insights.\nResearch Assistant, Secondary Schools Writing Center Association, Washington D.C. (November 2024 – Present)\nDesigned survey instruments, sampling frames, and contact workflows to maximize response rate. Built and maintained clean datasets from 300+ survey returns to support ongoing analysis."
